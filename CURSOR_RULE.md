# üìù Cursor Rule: Code Quality & UI/UX Excellence

All code in this project must adhere to the following principles:

## 1. Scalability & Architecture
- Design with modularity and separation of concerns (e.g., clear separation of frontend and backend).
- Use environment variables for secrets and configuration.
- Prefer stateless, reusable components and services.
- Write code that is easy to extend for future features.

## 2. Clean, Readable, and Understandable Code
- Use descriptive variable, function, and class names.
- Add comments and docstrings where logic is non-obvious.
- Follow language/framework style guides (e.g., PEP8 for Python, Airbnb/Prettier for JS/TS).
- Remove dead code and unnecessary comments.
- Keep functions and files focused and concise.

## 3. UI/UX Excellence
- Prioritize accessibility (ARIA, keyboard navigation, color contrast).
- Use responsive design for all screen sizes.
- Follow modern UI/UX patterns and best practices.
- Ensure fast load times and smooth interactions.
- Use consistent design tokens (spacing, colors, typography).

## 4. Testing & Validation
- Write unit and integration tests for critical logic.
- Validate user input on both client and server.
- Use type checking (TypeScript, mypy, etc.) where possible.

## 5. Documentation
- Document all public APIs, components, and modules.
- Update README and in-code docs with every major change.
